## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:


```{r}
#Create a {gtsummary} table of descriptive statistics about your data (1 pt)

#| label: tbl-sum_stats
#| tbl-cap: "This is a summary table."

tbl_summary(
	modified_data,
	by = gender,
	include = c(gender, arm, dose_strep_g, baseline_cavitation,
							improved, baseline_condition, strep_resistance, rad_num),
	label = list(
		arm ~ "Treatment",
		dose_strep_g ~ "Dose of Streptomycin (in grams)",
		baseline_condition ~ "Condition at Baseline",
		strep_resistance ~ "Resistance to Streptomycin at 6 months",
		baseline_cavitation ~ "Cavitation of Lungs at Baseline",
		improved ~ "Improved Outcome",
		rad_num ~ "Rating of Chest X-Ray at 6 months"
	))

```



```{r}
#Fit a regression (1 pt)
#| label: tbl-reg
#| tbl-cap: "These are regression results for whether patients improved or not. Improvement is categorized as binomial therefore the glm method was used in the regression model."
tbl_uvregression(
	modified_data,
	y = improved,
	include = c(gender, arm, dose_strep_g, baseline_cavitation,
							baseline_condition),
	label = list(
		gender ~ "Gender",
		arm ~ "Treatment",
		dose_strep_g ~ "Dose of Streptomycin (in grams)",
		baseline_condition ~ "Condition at Baseline",
		baseline_cavitation ~ "Cavitation of Lungs at Baseline"
	),
	method = glm,
	method.args = list(family = binomial),
	exponentiate = T
)
```

In the figure created  below patients were categorized as "Sensitive" = 1, "Moderate" = 2, and "Resistant" = 3. 

```{r}
#Create a figure (1 pt)
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: "Histogram demonstrates Streptomycin resistance in patients"
hist(as.numeric(modified_data$strep_resistance),
		 main = "Histogram of Streptomycin Resistance",
		 xlab = "Resistance Level",
		 breaks = 3)
``` 

```{r}
#Inline R code pulling a statistic from a table (i.e., using gtsummary::inline_text())

total_sample <- nrow(modified_data)
```
There were `r total_sample` participants. 

```{r}
#Inline R code printing something else (like we did with the mean age in the example) (1 pt) and cross reference (1 pt)

stats <- list(n = nrow(modified_data),
              mean_rad_num = mean(modified_data$rad_num))
```

There were `r stats$n` participants with a mean chest x-ray rating of `r stats$mean_rad_num`.

`@fig-hist` shows the distribution of streptomycin resistance and `@tbl-sum_stats` presents the overall descriptive statistics.

```{r}
#A brief description of the data, including its source (1 pt)
```

This data is a collection of patients with TB. The data summarizes their treatment history, gender, baseline characteristics such as cavitation and condition and a scale of resistance to the treatment drug streptomycin at six months.
